- `bash`, `curl`, `tar`: install these utilities.

## Install 
To use `share`, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/wokebuild/share/releases) to download the corresponding asset for your machine.

If you prefer the terminal, get your system architecture (`x86_64-linux` for linux, `x86_64-macos` or `x86_64-windows`) and run the below:
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/wokebuild/share/releases/download/v0.0.6/wokeshare-v0.0.6-<architecture>.tar.xz -o wokeshare.tar.xz
```
```shell
tar -xf wokeshare.tar.xz
cd wokeshare_v0.0.6-x86_64_linux/
/.share --help
```
You should get a reponse displaying the utilties for `share`
```
Share secrets securely through the terminal

Usage: share [OPTIONS] <MODE>

Arguments:
  <MODE>  The mode (share secrets, or rceive secrets)

Options:
  -s, --secret <SECRET>
          Separated list of secrets to share. Key-Value pair is seperated by a comma. "my_key,my_value"
      --remote-peer-id <REMOTE_PEER_ID>
          Peer ID of the remote to send secrets to
  -p, --port <PORT>
          Port to establish connection on
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```


## Usage
`share` enables transmission of secrets or messages between teammates using different machines and behind different networks. In order to share a secret, the sender and reciver need to both get `share` as described above and then follow the below instructions.

- The receiver
Open a terminal or `cd` to where `share` was installed, then:
```shell
./share receive
```
`share` starts in listen mode and assigns you a `PeerId` and picks a random port to start on. (An optional `-p` flag is available to specify a port). A reponse like below should be displayed:
```
  2023-07-10T23:05:09.740636Z  INFO share::hole_puncher: Local peer id: PeerId("12D3KooWLaLnHjKhQmB46jweVXCDKVy4AL58a4S4ZgHZGuJkzBf9")

    at src/hole_puncher.rs:215
```

- The sender
Obtain the `PeerId` of the teammate you wish to send a secret to, then:
```shell
./share send --remote-peer-id 12D3KooWLaLnHjKhQmB46jweVXCDKVy4AL58a4S4ZgHZGuJkzBf9 -s "hi,welcome"
```
`share` will print your IP address and your `PeerId`.
To verify that a connection was established and your machine can talk to your teammates, you should see a similar thing like below in your terminal:
```
  2023-07-10T23:10:47.574752Z  INFO share::hole_puncher: OutboundCircuitEstablished { relay_peer_id: PeerId("12D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4kx6nXTN"), limit: None }
    at src/hole_puncher.rs:223

  2023-07-10T23:10:49.753576Z  INFO share::hole_puncher: Established connection to PeerId("12D3KooWLaLnHjKhQmB46jweVXCDKVy4AL58a4S4ZgHZGuJkzBf9") via Dialer { address: "/ip4/157.245.40.97/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4kx6nXTN/p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWLaLnHjKhQmB46jweVXCDKVy4AL58a4S4ZgHZGuJkzBf9", role_override: Dialer }
    at src/hole_puncher.rs:235
```
The sender then attempts to send the secret and if it is successful, `share` relays  messages to both parties notifying the of status and the progress of the secret sharing session.
