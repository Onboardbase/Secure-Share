## Usage
`share` enables transmission of secrets or messages between teammates using different machines and behind different networks. In order to share a secret, the sender and reciver need to both get `share` as described above and then follow the below instructions.

#### The receiver:
Open a terminal or `cd` to where `share` was installed, then:
```shell
share receive
```
`share` starts in listen mode and assigns you a `PeerId` and picks a random port to start on. (An optional `-p` flag is available to specify a port). A reponse like below should be displayed:

```
INFO  Your PeerId is: 12D3KooWA768LzHMatxkjD1f9DrYW375GZJr6MHPCNEdDtHeTNRt

INFO  Listening on "/ip4/172.19.192.1/tcp/54654"

INFO  Listening on "/ip4/192.168.0.197/tcp/54654"

INFO  Listening on "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/54654"

INFO  Listening on "/ip4/157.245.40.97/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4kx6nXTN/p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWA768LzHMatxkjD1f9DrYW375GZJr6MHPCNEdDtHeTNRt"
```

#### The sender:
Obtain the `PeerId` of the teammate you wish to send a secret to, then:
```shell
share send -r 12D3KooWLaLnHjKhQmB46jweVXCDKVy4AL58a4S4ZgHZGuJkzBf9 -s "hi,welcome"
```
`share` will print your IP address and your `PeerId`.
To verify that a connection was established and your machine can talk to your teammates, you should see a similar thing like below in your terminal:
```
   INFO  Your PeerId is: 12D3KooWRpqX3QUvPNHXW5utkceLbx2b1LKfuAKa3iLdXXBGB2bY

   INFO  Listening on "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/40479"

   INFO  Listening on "/ip4/192.168.212.254/tcp/40479"

   INFO  Established connection to 12D3KooWA768LzHMatxkjD1f9DrYW375GZJr6MHPCNEdDtHeTNRt via /ip4/157.245.40.97/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4kx6nXTN/p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWA768LzHMatxkjD1f9DrYW375GZJr6MHPCNEdDtHeTNRt
```
The sender then attempts to send the secret and if it is successful, `share` relays  messages to both parties notifying them of status and the progress of the secret sharing session.
